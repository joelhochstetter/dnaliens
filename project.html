    <h1>Bacterial Destroyer</h1>
    <h3>A DNA-origami microbial destroyer</h3>
    <div class="tridmod"></div>
    <hr>
    <P>
      Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global public health problem. In 2016 alone, nearly 500 000 people died from multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Resistance is costly to healthcare, as traditional treatments become ineffective longer hospitalisations and more expensive drugs are required. 
    </P>
    <p>
      In our project, we are designing a DNA nanobot, which we call the UFO, that selectively destroys microbes to combat resistance. Our project has two sections; targeting and destruction. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The targeting section involves using DNA aptamers which are structures that can selectively bind to a particular microbe. Destruction methods we are exploring include disrupting microbial membranes with DNA-origami lipid nanopores. We are hiding our nanopore inside a DNA nanobot, and it is switched on for ‘destruction-mode’ only when it binds to a specific microbe. This technology could offer an alternative to antimicrobials such as antibiotics, which have been implicated in the emergence of superbugs.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Building structures at the nanoscale can prove challenging because of limited techniques available and forces like Brownian motion need now be considered, but with the development of DNA origami, programmed self-assembly of distinct DNA structures is possible.x Since its discovery, DNA origamis have progressed from simple 2D shapes to functional 3D nanostructures.x</p>
    <p><img src="/dnaliens/images/branding/DNA_UFO.png" style="width: 12rem;" class="imgcenter"></p>
    <!-- Pictures -->
    <p>An area of hot research in this field is DNA origami involved in lipid interactions. By incorporating hydrophobic molecules like cholesterol and porphyrin to DNA origamis, this allows structures to embed into lipid membranes.x-y A range of lipid-interacting DNA nanopores have been reported with functions from inducing ionic currents mimicking biological ion channels to scrambling and perturbing biological membranes and potentially inducing cell death. x-y These are all exciting functional nanostructures that could potentially be significant to research in biochemistry and the development of clinically useful novel therapeutics. However, a switchable origami where lipid interactions can be controlled and turned on and off is yet to be constructed.</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p><img src="/dnaliens/images/project/headlines.gif" style="max-width: 53vw;" class="imgcenter"></p>
    <p>In this project we chose to try and tackle a topical issue in the public sphere, antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance occurs when harmful microorganisms; bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa, evolve to grow in the presence of medications that in the past would normally have killed or stopped their growth. This has led to the emergence of ‘superbugs’ such as Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial resistance is a significant global health issue that is costly to healthcare as traditional treatments become ineffective, longer hospitalisations and more expensive drugs are required. In fact drug resistant infections are implicated in nearly 700 000 deaths yearly.x In a recent study commissioned by the UK government, it was predicted that by 2050, 10 million people will die from antimicrobial resistance each year if nothing is done about this issue.x To put that into perspective, the number of deaths from drug resistant infections will surpass that of deaths currently caused by cancer.x Thus, the demand for novel therapeutics with entirely distinct mechanisms of action from therapeutics currently in market are needed to address such a pressing issue.

    <h2>Our solution</h2>

    <p>Drawing our inspiration from nature, antimicrobial peptides occur naturally and are produced by organisms as a first-line of defence and act by destabilising biological membranes.x  These antimicrobial peptides have been reported to create pores that result in leakage of cellular components.x By combining nature’s concept of pores for destruction of microbes and existing work in the field on DNA nanopores, the aim of our project is to design a switchable DNA nanopore that can be used to combat antimicrobial resistance by selectively disrupting homeostasis in harmful bacteria cells. This approach is different from traditional chemical drug-based approaches and offers a novel mechanism of action with the potential to tackle antimicrobial resistance.</p>

    <p>Our nanopore is decorated with cholesterol moieties to allow embedding into cell membranes, to create a physical hole for molecules to flow through. It is anticipated this pore will disrupt biological membranes and cellular concentrations thus leading to cell death.</p>

    <p>However, the nanopore insertion is mediated by non-specific hydrophobic interactions between cholesterols and cell membranes. As a result, no selectivity can be achieved between human cells, healthy bacteria and harmful bacteria. To achieve selectivity, our nanopore will be enclosed in a DNA barrel and only released when it reaches it target. In its switched off state the nanopore will be held tightly inside the barrel such that the nanopore is not free to insert into lipid membranes. Once switched on, the nanopore will be slingshotted out of the barrel and free for insertion into lipid membranes for destruction.</p>

    <p>The switch mechanism will involve [insert bacteria selectivity stuff from Clare Mahon] and allow selective targeting of harmful bacteria as the destructive pore will only be released once it reaches its target. </p>

    <h2>Project goals</h2>
    <p>The ultimate goal of this project is to design a switchable DNA nanopore for destruction of microbes. Our project can be divided into two distinct sections; targeting and destruction. Given the timeframe of BIOMOD, we decided to focus our research on the destruction aspect of the project and leave the targeting of microbes for future work.</p>

    <p>The goal of our project within the timeframe of this competition is to design a DNA nanopore that can embed into lipid membranes and to design a switch for this nanopore to control nanopore insertion into the membrane. Since targeting is not within the scope of our project, a simplification of the trigger for the on/off state of the origami will be used using DNA displacement strands to demonstrate DNA origami can be switched between two state. These goals were picked to show a proof of concept of the system.</p>

    <h2>Criteria for success</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>DNA nanopore</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Make DNA nanopore and show structure is correctly folded</li>
        <li>Optimise folding conditions for existing DNA nanopores</li>
        <li>Check that DNA nanopores can insert into lipid membranes</li>
        <li>Test nanopore in a synthetic system to show ‘leakage’ abilities</li>
        <li>Determine what molecules can be transported through the nanopore</li>
        <li>Test the cell destruction capabilities of this nanopore</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Switchability of DNA nanopore</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Design DNA displacement strands as a trigger mechanism for switchability between two states</li>
        <li>Show DNA origami can interact with liposomes <em>via</em> TEM</li>
        <li>Show DNA origami can switch between two different states; inactivated (nanopore held in barrel) and activated (nanopore free to embed into lipid membranes) <em>via</em> TEM</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <h1 id="Feasibility">Feasibility</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>To assess the feasibility of this project, we referred to the triple constraint in project management which considers the three most significant restrictions in any project; scope, cost and time. </p>

    <p><img src="/dnaliens/images/project/projectTri.png" style="max-width: 25vw;" class="imgcenter"></p>

    <p>When determining the scope of our project, we considered the interests of the team and the expertise of our supervisors. We decided to focus our project on antimicrobial resistance because of its topical nature and attention in the public sphere. As scientists we were all also interested in novel therapeutics to combat antimicrobial resistance. We narrowed our project to focus on the destruction of microbes because of the limited timeframe of the competition with the project needing to be delivered within a year. Our time was also limited by the fact that we only had a month to work on the project fulltime in our winter break as during the semester we also had classes to attend. As a result, for the scope of this project we focused on the nanopore design and switchability, leaving targeting for future research.</p>

    <p>In terms of our supervisors’ expertise we decided to work on DNA origami. DNA origami is also cheap to order and can be delivered in a timely fashion and easy to work with because of its stability and low toxicity. The lab we were working in also was set up for DNA origami experiments, highlighting the feasibility of this technique for our team in terms of cost and time. We also utilised existing experimental protocols to fold and purify our DNA origamis and existing assays to test their transport ability. This allowed us to also save time as less optimisations were required for existing protocols, ensuring the feasibility of this project within the timeframe.  </p>
