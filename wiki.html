        The four-helix bundle (4HB) is a DNA nanostructure found to perturb biological membranes [1]. Eight strands of DNA fold to form a four-helix structure that inserts across lipid bilayers to form a toroidal pore (Figure 1). The 4HB features three variants differing the number of conjugated cholesterol moieties; 4HB.0C, 4HB.1C and 4HB.2C with respectively no cholesterol, 1 cholesterol and 2 cholesterols. 4HB.2C was the only variant to successfully function as two cholesterol tags are required to anchor the structure into the membrane via hydrophobic interactions on an otherwise hydrophilic DNA structure [1]. Since this membrane distribution is well characterised, it is the first candidate for our design. Our first steps were to reproduce this design, and optimise the yield and folding purity.

DNA helices are represented as red cylinders while the hydrophobic cholesterol groups facilitating anchoring into lipid membranes is represented as white ovals.

      <p>
        Larger DNA nanopores have also been reported in literature, featuring six DNA helices where ionic current measurements confirm transmembrane insertion [2]. The six-helix bundle (6HB) was designed because the larger pore was hypothesised to achieve greater bacterial destruction as a larger pore diameter can allow for greater leakage of cellular components (Figure 2). The 6HB design is based off an existing six-helical pore with two porphyrin tags [2]. However instead of the porphyrin tags, five cholesterol molecules are used as a substitute because cholesterol modified DNA strands are commercially available. The 6HB consists of 12 DNA that fold together and details about the design can be found here.

      <h2 id="o2">Aims</h2>
      <!-- Put your contents inside the tag -->
      <p>
        To optimise the folding of 4HB.2C by considering DNA concentration, folding time and concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> folding buffer. <br>To show 6HB design can fold correctly into a nanopore.
      </p>

      <h2 id="o3">Methods</h2>
      <!-- Put your contents inside the tag -->
      <h3>General Protocol for 4HB.0C</h3>
      <p>
        The reported protocol involved the folding of all DNA strands (0.1 µM for each strand, strands 1-8) in MgCl<sub>2</sub> (20 mM) for 18 h in a PCR machine (heating to 80° for 5 min, cooling down to 65° using a linear cooling ramp over 75 min, subsequently cooling to 25° within 16 h). BlueJuice loading buffer (Life Tech) was added to folded samples, with the solution then loaded onto a native PAGE (10% acrylamide, 11 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 x TBE, 0.1% APS, 0.1% TEMED) for 60-90 min at 100 V in tris-borate-EDTA buffer (11 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The gel was stained with SyBr Gold and imaged using a ChemiDoc<sup>TM</sup> gel imaging system. This general protocol was varied to identify the optimal conditions of folding. 
      </p>

      <u>Stepwise folding of 4HB.0C </u>
      <p>
        To verify the successful folding of the structure, a stepwise protocol was performed. The general protocol was varied whereby folding was performed with only strand 1 (0.1 µM), only strands 1-2 (0.1 µM), only strands 1 -3 (0.1 µM) … adding one additional strand until all 8 strands were used. 
      </p>

      <u>Comparison of 4HB.0C, 1C, 2C</u>
      <p>
        The general protocol of 4HB.0C was identical for the other variants of 4HB, except for the substitution of strands with their cholesterol-tagged equivalents. 4HB.1C used a cholesterol tagged equivalent of Strand 2. 4HB.2C folding used cholesterol tagged equivalents of strands 2 and 4. 
      </p>

      <h3>Optimisation of DNA concentration</h3>
      <u>Total DNA concentration</u>
      <p>
        The general protocol was followed for all three variants of 4HB, except final folding concentration of DNA strands were varied; 0.1 µM, 1 µM and 10 µM.  After folding was complete, 1 µM was diluted 1/10 and 10 µM was diluted 1/100 prior to loading. This normalisation is required to give a representation of % yield; accounting for the different starting amounts of DNA. 
      </p>

      <u>Strand Ratio</u>
      <p>
        The general protocol was followed for 4HB.2C, except the concentration of all strands without cholesterol were increased to 0.5 µM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general protocol was followed for 4HB.2C, except the concentration of all strands with cholesterol were increased to 0.5 µM. 
      </p>

      <h3>Optimisation of folding time </h3>
      <p>
        The general protocol was followed for 4HB.0C, except the folding time was varied; 10 min, 1 h, 2 h and 18 h. Samples were normalised to 0.2 µM prior to loading. 
      </p>

      <h3>Optimisation of Mg<sup>2+</sup> folding buffer</h3>
      <p>
        The general protocol was followed for 4HB.0C, except the folding time (was changed to 2 h) and the final folding MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration was varied; 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM. Samples were nomralised to 0.1 µM DNA prior to loading. 
      </p>

      <h3>General Protocol for 6HB</h3>
      <p>
        Equimolar concentrations of the 12 DNA strands (0.1 µM) were folded in MgCl<sub>2</sub> (12 mM and 20 mM) for 18 h in a PCR machine (heating to X and cycling between 50° and 40° over X min). BlueJuice loading buffer (Life Tech) was added to folded samples, with the solution then loaded onto a native PAGE (8% acrylamide, 11 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 x TBE, 0.1% APS, 0.1% TEMED) for 2 h at 100 V in tris-borate-EDTA buffer (11 mM MgCl2). The gel was stained with SyBr Gold and imaged using a ChemiDocTM gel imaging system. 
      </p>
      <u>Stepwise folding of 6HB</u>
      <p>
        To verify the successful folding 6HB at 0.1 µM, a stepwise protocol was performed with MgCl<sub>2</sub> (12 mM and 20 mM). In the design of the 6HB, six of the 12 DNA strands are considered staple strands and the other six are considered scaffold strands. The staple strands were pooled and folding was performed on just staples, staples and addition of two scaffold strands, staples and addition of four scaffold strands and finally all 12 strands.
      </p>

      <h3>Proof of successful folding</h3>
      <u>Stepwise folding of 4HB.0C</u>
      <p>
        The loose strands quickly move to the bottom of the gel (Figure 2.3). An additional band of higher molecular weight was not observed until the folding of strands 1-6, indicating a structure has folded. The structure formed by strands 1-7 has an increased weight as does the structure formed by strands 1 -8 which is expected by the incorporation of more DNA to the folded structure (Figure 2.3). 
      </p>

          <b>Figure 2.3. Stepwise folding of 4HB 0C.</b> 10% PAGE (11 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) run for 90 min at 100 V. Lane 1: 25 bp ladder, Lane 2: Strand 1, Lane 3: Strand 1 – 2, Lane 4: Strand 1 – 3, Lane 5: Strand 1 – 4, Lane 6: Strand 1 – 5, Lane 7: Strand 1 – 6, Lane 8: Strand 1 – 7, Lane 9: Strand 1 – 8.  
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <u>Comparison of 4HB.0C, 1C, 2C</u>
      <p>
        The cholesterol moiety increases the molecule weight of the structure and hence reduces the distance of the band down the gel. This difference in molecular weight is observed where by 4HB.0C travels further than 4HB.1C and 4HB.2C. 4HB.2C travels the least distance as it has the highest molecular weight (Figure 2.4).

      <h3>Optimisation of DNA concentration</h3>
      <u>Total DNA concentration</u>
      <p>
        The optimum folding concentration was determined to be 10 uM for all three 4HB variants; 0C, 1C and 2C. This is since the 10 uM folding condition lead to a much brighter band compared to the 0.1 and 1 uM conditions after normalisation of loading concentration.

      <u>Strand Ratio</u>
      <p>
      	Altering the strand ratio did not significantly increase the yield of 4HB.2C whereby bands were of relatively similar brightness (Figure 2.6). Furthermore, both excess cholesterol strands and excess non-cholesterol strands lead to increased smearing observable in the gel. Consequently, equimolar amounts of each DNA strand was determined to be the optimum condition.

      <h3>Optimisation of folding time</h3>
      <p>
        18 hr and 2 hr folding times gave bands of similar intensity and sharpness (Figure 2.7). Shorter folding times led to blurrier bands and a greater degree of smearing on the gel indicating aggregates. Leaving the DNA strands at room temperature without any PCR folding protocol gave a very poor yield of 4HB. Therefore, 2 hr was chosen as the optimum folding time as it gave similar results to 18 hr while also being a far more practical option.

      <h3>Optimisation of MgCl<sub>2</sub> folding buffer</h3>
      <p>
      	Since Mg<sup>2+</sup> stabilises the folded DNA structure by shielding the electrostatic repulsion between negative phosphate backbone of DNA, it was expected that lower MgCl<sub>2</sub> would give lower yield. This was observed where 5 mM MgCl2 lead to a slightly dimmer band (Figure 2.8). No significant differences in sharpness or brightness were noticeable between 10, 20 and 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, however 30 mM showed greater aggregation and smearing. The reported concentration of 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was therefore maintained. Since lower MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration is favourable in the functioning of the Liposome Transport Assay, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was also used in further work.

      <h2 id="o5">Discussion</h2>
      <!-- Put your contents inside the tag -->
      <p>
      	The DNA strand concentration of 10 µM was determined to be optimum in the folding of all three variants of 4HB, with adding strands in excess having no significant improvement in yield. The folding time of 2 hr gave comparable results to 18 hr in 4HB.0C and other MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations did not significantly improve results at 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Further optimisation could be performed by combining the variables, for example examining different MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations at the 2 hr folding time. Due to the limitations in quantities of cholesterol tagged DNA the optimisation was performed for 4HB.0C and assumed to correspond to 4HB.2C. This is since cholesterol moieties should not significantly affect the nature of 4HB folding. The success of this optimisation could be confirmed further by directly comparing the reported literature conditions against the optimised conditions.         
      </p>

      <p>
        The 6HB was determined to have folded from the PAGE (Figure 2.9). The unfolded loose strands move quicker through the gel. As scaffold strands are incorporated this can be seen as a retardation in the band of the gel as it runs slower because of the increased molecular weight (Figure 2.9). Since a retardation is seen between each of the four steps in the stepwise addition, this indicates that when 12 strands of DNA are folded together, all are incorporated into the structure. The bands for 6HB folded at MgCl<sub>2</sub> 20 mM are brighter and less diffuse than the ones folded at MgCl<sub>2</sub> 12 mM, indicating that 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> is a better folding buffer concentration for the 6HB. Future work can include optimising the folding conditions for 6HB and folding the 6HB variant decorated with cholesterol molecules (Figure 2.10).

      <p>
        Previously in literature DNA nanopores have been tested with a range of techniques. One such technique is current-voltage recordings across lipid bilayers to measure ion conductance of nanopores [1]. By looking at current traces at a constant voltage, changes in current may indicate nanopore insertion into lipid bilayers to an ion conducting orientation [1]. Confocal fluorescence microscopy has also been used to spatially determine nanopore and giant unilamellar vesicle interactions [1,2]. A dithionate reduction assay has also been able to probe for lipid scrambling induced by DNA nanopores, where flipping of lipids from one leaflet to the next can be observed via changes in fluorescence [2]. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our assay probes for the leakage ability of our nanopores using synthetic POPC liposomes as a model for cells and fluorescence to monitor changes in liposome content [3]. The advantage of this assay is that it can be used to elucidate the identity of ions that can pass through our DNA nanopores. A pH gradient is setup where the pH inside the liposomes is pH 7 and the external solution is pH 8 (Figure 1 and 2). Once a nanopore is added this will allow the pH gradient to dissipate, that is protons are moved out the liposomes to equilibrate the pH of the internal and external solutions and there are two proposed mechanisms for this (Figure 1 and 2).

        pH of the liposomes can be monitored with 8-Hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS), a ratiometric fluorophore that can detect changes in pH through the protonation equilibrium of the hydroxyl of HPTS (Figure 3) [4]. pH changes can be detected via fluorescence as the protonated form of HPTS results in greater emission at 403 nm and greater emission at 460 nm for the deprotonated form. By taking the ratio of fluorescence emission intensity at 460 nm and 403 nm, proton efflux from the liposomes can be detected and thus the transport abilities of the nanopore can be determined [3].

      <!-- Put your contents inside the tag -->
      <p>
        1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was dissolved in chloroform. POPC in chloroform was dehydrated and dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator. An internal solution of potassium gluconate (K-Glu) (100 mM) and 8-Hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) (1 mM) was prepared at pH 7. The lipid was rehydrated with the internal solution and vortexed for 10 min. The lipid was freeze thawed nine times with liquid nitrogen to create ununiform liposomes. Liposomes were size extruded through a 200 nm polycarbonate filter 25 times to afford uniform 200 nm unilamellar liposomes. An external solution of potassium gluconate (100 mM) was prepared at pH 7. Liposomes were run through a Sephadex-50 size extrusion column with the external solution to remove any HPTS not encapsulated by the liposomes.    
      </p>

      <p>
        For the assay, liposomes (0.1 mM POPC) were suspended in the external solution. Various concentrations of DNA nanopore 4-helix bundle (4HB) were added (0.1-1 mol%) and potassium hydroxide to raise external solution to pH 8. The solution was stirred for 20 min. To start assay, valinomycin (0.05 mol%) was added at time 10s and fluorescence at 460 nm and 403 nm was monitored over 12 min. Valinomycin is required to start the assay because it is a known potassium transporter and transport of potassium ions is required to maintain charge potential across membrane. At 10 min, detergent was added to lyse liposomes and fluorescence at 460 nm and 403 nm was monitored for a further 12 min. This assay was repeated with a known proton transporter, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) as a positive control, and with free DNA strands tagged with cholesterol as a negative control.

      <h2 id="t5">Discussion</h2>
      <!-- Put your contents inside the tag -->
      <p>
        The liposome assay showed that 4HB was able to dissipate the pH gradient in the presence of valinomycin, which indicates the ability of the nanopore to transport protons out of the liposomes (Figure 2). Since the assay did not run when valinomycin was not added, this indicates that the channels are not capable of transporting potassium ions (Figure 1). Transport of potassium ions into the liposomes are required for protons to be transported out because this maintains electrical potential across the lipid bilayer. When potassium ions are not transported into the liposomes charge build up across the lipid bilayer stopping further proton transport out. It is proposed that the 4HB nanopore cannot transport potassium ions due to their large size because the atomic radius of a potassium ion is larger than a proton. An alternative mechanism to dissipate the pH gradient is the transport hydroxide into the liposomes, however this mechanism is less likely due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged hydroxide and DNA. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Liposomes were lysed at 10 min to release HPTS and fluorescence was monitored for an additional 2 min to show fluorescence at time where pH between the internal and external liposome solutions have equilibrated. CCCP is a known proton transporter and was used as a positive control in this experiment. Free DNA strands tagged with cholesterol were added as a negative control to show unfolded DNA does not disrupt liposomes or cause transport. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Future work can include performing other liposomes assays to test the transport ability of 4HB for other ions by switching to different internal and external liposome solutions. An ion selective electrode can also be used to monitor transport by measuring changes in concentration of a particular ion in the external solution, thus monitoring ion efflux [3].
      </p>

      <h2 id="t6">Conclusion</h2>
      <!-- Put your contents inside the tag -->
      <p>
        Conclusively, the DNA nanopore 4HB can create a pore in synthetic POPC liposomes to transport protons out of the liposomes but is unable to facilitate potassium ion transport. This is likely due to the pore size being too small for the larger cation.
